Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent









(highlight) the reasons for the code refactoring that you have observed)
i've seen multiple large functions in a codebase, it might be a sign that 
the code is not well-organized and might be difficult to maintain and modify in the future. 
It's generally a good practice to break down large functions into smaller,
more manageable ones that perform a single task. This makes the code easier to read and understand, 
and it also helps to reduce the chances of introducing bugs when modifying the code.
When breaking down a large function into smaller ones, 
it's important to keep in mind the principles of modularity and single responsibility.
Each function should perform a single, well-defined task and should have a clear input and output. 
By doing this, you can create a more maintainable and scalable codebase that is easier to work with in the long run.








1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
method distanceFeed 

Using only() makes the code more readable by clearly showing which fields are being used from the request.
Combining the checks into a single empty() call makes the code shorter and easier to read.
Using the null coalescing operator simplifies the code and makes it more concise.
Combining variable assignments makes the code more readable and reduces repetition.
Adding default values for $distance and $time prevents undefined variable errors, which can improve the code's reliability.

method  getPotentialJobIdsWithUserId

Instead of using if-else statements, we use a ternary operator to set the value of $job_type.
Instead of using collect() and pluck(), we can use the pluck()
method directly on the UserLanguages model to get the $userlanguage array.
We use a higher-order function (filter()) to filter the $job_ids collection based on the checkTowns()
function and the customer phone and physical type.
We remove the unnecessary foreach loop and use the $job_ids collection directly in convertJobIdsInObjs() method.




2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php
methods getUsersJobs
The getUsersJobs method was refactored to optimize its performance and
make the code more readable. The changes include using compact()
to return the results, removing unnecessary if statement and setting default 
empty arrays for $emergencyJobs and $normalJobs. The nested foreach loop was
replaced with a single loop using collect() and the each() method. Additionally, the whereIn() 
and orderBy() methods were chained directly to the query instead of separate method calls.



3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt

I have used destructuring to avoid assigning variables on separate lines.
I have removed unnecessary curly braces, elseif, and else statements to make the code shorter.
I have used the ternary operator to simplify the code and reduce the number of lines.
I have used the copy() method to create a new instance of the Carbon object to avoid modifying the original objects.
I have used consistent indentation to improve readability.




4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate
lines changes reason from 
Used the fill method to mass assign values to the $model object.
Used the null coalescing operator ?? to set default values for $model->company_id and $model->department_id.
Used the only method to retrieve only the specified keys from the $model object.

there is another way to refactor the lengthy method
Dividing lengthy methods into sub-methods has several benefits
-> Readability and maintainability: 
-> Code reuse:
-> Testing: Dividing lengthy methods into smaller sub-methods also makes testing easier. Instead of testing a single lengthy method
-> Clarity and organization

public function createOrUpdate(Request $request, $id)
{
    $model = User::find($id);
    $this->updateUserInformation($request, $model);

    if ($request['translator_ex']) {
        $this->updateUserBlacklist($request, $model);
    } else {
    }

    return response()->json(['message' => 'success']);
}

private function updateUserInformation(Request $request, User $model)
{
    $this->updateUserCompanyInformation($request, $model);
}
